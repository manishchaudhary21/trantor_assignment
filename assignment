1) Write a function getwords(text) to take a string, parse it and return words (tokens). 

2) clearnwords.py -  Modify getwords and call it cleanwords(text). Cleanwords removes punctuation,

removes words which are just numbers, convert all words to lower case and return them.

3) wordfreq.py - open a text file, read the text, process it using clearnwords.

Count the number of occurences of each unique word.

4) Modify wordfreq.py to open a second file that contains only noise words. 
Create a word frequency eliminating all the noise words. 
(source of noise words)

5) tagcloud.py - Use wordfreq to generate a html tag cloud (an html tag cloud displays words in alphabetical order.

The higher the word frequency, the bigger the word. 

6) linkedcloud.py - Modify tagcloud.py to link each word to all the lines that contain it.

For example, when you click on a word, it should display all the lines where the word occurs. 

7) Create new files and Change 3-4-5-6 to create bigram cloud (pairs of words) instead of single word cloud.

Create a git repo, upload these tasks as you finish each task and send the url of that repo.
Try to complete as many as possible, for any further clarification feel free to contact the concern person
