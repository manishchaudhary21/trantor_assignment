1) Write a function getwords(text) to take a string, parse it and return words (tokens). 

2) clearnwords.py -  Modify getwords and call it cleanwords(text). Cleanwords removes punctuation,

removes words which are just numbers, convert all words to lower case and return them.

3) wordfreq.py - open a text file, read the text, process it using clearnwords.

Count the number of occurences of each unique word.

4) Modify wordfreq.py to open a second file that contains only noise words. 
Create a word frequency eliminating all the noise words. 
(source of noise words)

5) tagcloud.py - Use wordfreq to generate a html tag cloud (an html tag cloud displays words in alphabetical order.

The higher the word frequency, the bigger the word. 

6) linkedcloud.py - Modify tagcloud.py to link each word to all the lines that contain it.

For example, when you click on a word, it should display all the lines where the word occurs. 

7) Create new files and Change 3-4-5-6 to create bigram cloud (pairs of words) instead of single word cloud.
